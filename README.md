Digital Image Processing (DIP) Python Codes
This repository contains various Python implementations of digital image processing algorithms and techniques. Each implementation is designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in image processing and provide practical examples for educational purposes. The algorithms included are:

Algorithms and Techniques
Shannon-Fano Coding: An entropy coding technique that is used for lossless data compression.

Arithmetic Coding: A form of entropy coding that converts a message into a single number in the interval [0, 1), providing efficient data representation.

Grayscale Conversion: Techniques to convert color images to grayscale, facilitating simpler analysis and processing.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A classification algorithm that identifies the k-nearest data points in a dataset to classify an image based on similarity.

Local Binary Patterns (LBP): A texture descriptor used for facial recognition and texture classification, which converts an image into a binary pattern representation.

Bit Slicing: A technique to extract and manipulate individual bits of an image, useful for analyzing and enhancing image features.
